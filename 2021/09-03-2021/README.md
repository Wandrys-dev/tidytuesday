The Bechdel Test
</h1>

The data this week comes from FiveThirtyEight, and relates to whether or not movies from 1970 - 2013 pass the Bechdel test. Alison Bechdel created a test to measure the gender bias in movies. It said that if a movie can satisfy three criteria — there are at least two named women in the picture, they have a conversation with each other at some point, and that conversation isn’t about a male character — then it passes the test.

Here, I visualised the distributions of passes and fails for films between 1970 and 2013, for nine directors. Of the nine considered, Woody Allen had the highest proportion of films pass the Bechdel test.
