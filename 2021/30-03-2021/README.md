Makeup Shades
</h1>

The data this week comes from The Pudding. Beauty brands often label foundation shades with sequential numbers, which implicitly prioritises those at the beginning of the sequence. Most companies rank lighter shades of foundation higher, and therefore prioritise customers with lighter skin. This week I looked at the shades of foundation on sale from Fenty Beauty, Revlon bareMinerals, L'Oreal, Maybelline, and Origins, and how they rank different shades.
