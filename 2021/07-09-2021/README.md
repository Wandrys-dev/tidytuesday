Formula 1 Winning Times </h1>
  
There was a sharp drop in winning times in the late fifties, and they continued to decrease until the 1970s where winning times have since levelled off. Since 2010 there has been a notable increase in the number of slower winning times. 
British  manufacturers dominated between 1960 and 2000, but have produced few winners since then.
