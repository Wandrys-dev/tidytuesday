University Education in Kenya</h1>

The data this week comes from [`rKenyaCensus`](https://github.com/Shelmith-Kariuki/rKenyaCensus) courtesy of Shelmith Kariuki. In this visualisation, the colour of each region represents the difference in the percentage of males and females who are educated to university level. In terms of percentages, there is always a higher percentage of men who are educated to univeristy level in every region.
