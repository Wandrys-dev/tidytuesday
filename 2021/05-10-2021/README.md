Hourly Wages of Registered Nurses</h1>

As of 2020, the median hourly wage of registered nurses in the US is \$34.07, compared to \$18.48 in 1998. However, increases in hourly wages are mostly seen at the top end of the scale: the 10th percentile pay in 1998 was \$14.10 and increased to only \$25.87 in 2020. Wages may be slowly increasing but the gap between the highest and lowest paid nurses is widening. A higher number of registered nurses is correlated with higher hourly wages.
