Mario Kart 64 World Records </h1>
The number of world records for a single lap for each of the tracks for Mario Kart 64, for players in different countries. Only Australia, Germany, the Netherlands, and the USA have held world records on every track. 

I also look at the world records for the fastest time for a single lap of Mario Kart 64: Mario Raceway. The average time for a player to hold a world record is 453 days for NTSC systems, and 218 days for PAL systems.
