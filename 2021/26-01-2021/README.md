Plastic Types
</h1>

The data this week comes from Break Free from Plastic -- an organisation which aims to bring systemic change through a holistic approach tackling plastic pollution across the whole plastics value chain, focusing on prevention rather than cure, and providing effective solutions. Here, I visualise the percentage of each of the types of plastics found during Break Free From Plastic cleanups in nine different countries. China has a significantly higher percentage of polyester waste than any other types of plastic, in constrast to other countries.
