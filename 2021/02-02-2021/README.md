HBCU Enrollment
</h1>

This data comes from Data.World and was originally from the NCES. The data considers fall enrollment in degree-granting historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs), by gender and race. The number of women attending HMCUs is consistently higher than the number of men. However, the number of black women attending HMBCUs has declined more steeply than other groups in recent years.
